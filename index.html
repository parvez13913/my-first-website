            <p>I am Parvez Rahman. I am a student of Programming Hero. I like programming very much. I wanted to study computer science from a young age, I passed HSC in 2019 but could not get a very good result. So I decided to take the HSC exam again in 2020. After that, the Corona epidemic came all over the world. Due to Karna, I gradually lost interest in studying, then I passed HSC examination with 4.8 result. After that comes Admission examination.After that comes the admission test, I started preparing for the admission test, it will start even though the admission test was not taking place. Gradually I lost interest in studying again, I did not study semen in Pandamik. I forgot all the preparation that was done, then I went to give the test even though I was not ready. In the end I didn't find Chanch anywhere. College Jhenaidah, is admitted in Chemistry. I already knew about Jhangkar Bhai's programming hero course,After much thought, I decided that I would be admitted to this course. This is my first job learning from a programming hero. Thank you all for praying.</p>
